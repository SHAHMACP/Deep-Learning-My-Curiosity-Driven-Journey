## Deep Learning Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction is a key business analytics task that helps organizations identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services. Accurate churn prediction allows companies to proactively design retention strategies, minimize revenue loss, and improve long-term customer relationships.

This project implements a **deep learning–based classification pipeline** to predict customer churn from structured customer data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, categorical encoding, feature preparation, and train–test splitting to ensure the dataset is suitable for neural network training.

A fully connected neural network is developed to capture nonlinear relationships and hidden behavioral patterns in the data. Through training and evaluation, the model demonstrates how deep learning techniques can effectively model customer churn and support data-driven decision making.

This repository showcases the practical application of preprocessing pipelines and neural network modeling for solving a real-world predictive analytics problem.
